Use SQL to help NASA create, alter, and insert data into a database that stores all of this important information. Then practice querying the database with various `SELECT` statements. We will select different columns, and employ other SQL clauses like `WHERE` to return the data we would like."

For example, when you start to write your own re-usable code for cleaning up data you might well decide to create some Python files that you can access from and share between different Notebooks. **"
